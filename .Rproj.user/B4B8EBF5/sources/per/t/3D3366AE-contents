### Variable Definition
# survival	Survival	0 = No, 1 = Yes
# pclass	Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
# sex	Sex	
# Age	Age in years	
# sibsp	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
# parch	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
# ticket	Ticket number	
# fare	Passenger fare	
# cabin	Cabin number	
# embarked	Port of Embarkation


#### 1. Data Load
train <- read.csv('data/train.csv', na.strings = c('','NA')) # 애초에 로딩할 때 부터 공백은 NA로 출력되도록 설정하기
test <- read.csv('data/test.csv', na.strings = c('','NA'))
all <- bind_rows(train,test) # 두개의 데이터를 합친다.
all_Origin <- all


#### 2. Data Check
str(all)
summary(all)
glimpse(all)

#### 3. Count Survival
train %>% count(Survived)
surv <- train %>% count(Survived) %>% filter(Survived == 1) %>% .$n
nosurv <- train %>% count(Survived) %>% filter(Survived == 0) %>% .$n

# Survival Rate
train %>% 
  summarise(Rate_Suv = sum(Survived,na.rm = T) / nrow(train) * 100)

# Factor Recoding

# 1) Sex, Pclass
all <- all %>%
  mutate(Sex = factor(Sex),
         Pclass = factor(Pclass))
# 2) Survived
all <- all %>%
  mutate(Survived = factor(Survived)) %>% 
  mutate(Survived = fct_recode(Survived, 'No'='0','Yes'='1'))


# Visualization
ggplot(data = all[1:891, ], mapping = aes(Sex, fill=Survived))+
  geom_bar(position='fill')+
  geom_hline(yintercept = sum(train$Survived)/nrow(train), lty = 2, col = 'white')
